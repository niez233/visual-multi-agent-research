Female baboons in a group can form social bonds, or close relationships, with other females. Most female baboons form social bonds, but some have stronger bonds than others. Females that have stronger social bonds spend more time grooming, or cleaning, each other.\nWhen a female has strong social bonds with other females, more of her offspring reach adulthood than the offspring of females with weak social bonds.

Read the passage about a specific animal behavior. Then, follow the instructions below.\n\nBlunthead cichlids (SIK-lids) are fish that live in Lake Tanganyika in Eastern Africa. After a female blunthead cichlid lays eggs, she holds the eggs in her mouth. Once they hatch, her young fish live in her mouth until they are old enough to survive on their own. This process, called mouthbrooding, takes about six weeks.\nWhile mouthbrooding, the female cichlid catches algae from the lake. But she does not swallow any. Instead, she feeds the algae to her offspring by holding it in her mouth for the offspring to eat. By eating the algae, the offspring grow larger and become faster swimmers that can escape predators more quickly.\nFigure: a blunthead cichlid.", "choices": {"A": "the female will become weak and unhealthy", "B": "the female's offspring will survive", "C": "the female will hold more offspring in her mouth"}, "answer": "B", "meta": {"source": "MMBench", "dataset_id": "HuggingFaceM4/MMBench_dev", "split": "train"}}

As the crew waited to have breakfast, a strong smell of sulfur drifted over the boat. At first, crew members thought that the cook had burned the eggs or that something was wrong with the boat's engine. But when the sun started to rise, the crew saw black smoke billowing from the water a few kilometers away.\nThe captain of the Isleifur II assumed the smoke was coming from a boat that was on fire, so he sailed closer to try to help. As the Isleifur II approached the smoke, the surface of the sea grew rough. The captain and crew saw flashes of lightning in the column of smoke and glowing pieces of molten rock shooting up out of the water. The captain realized this was not a burning boat.
