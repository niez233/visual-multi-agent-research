Read the passage about a specific animal behavior. Then, follow the instructions below.\n\nAfrican lions live in groups called prides. In a pride, female lions, or lionesses, may give birth to cubs around the same time. When this happens, the lionesses help raise each other's cubs. The lionesses work together to feed and protect all the cubs for about two years.\nLionesses have to protect their cubs from male lions that are not part of their pride. These male lions may attack and kill the cubs to try to take over the pride. When a pride has multiple lionesses, the cubs are less likely to be killed in an attack.
